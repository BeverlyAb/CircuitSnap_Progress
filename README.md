# CircuitSnap_Progress
I served as Assistant Project Manager for CircuitSnap. Although this project has been through numerous versions under CSUSB's Software Engineering course, this code includes work done by my team and our progress. The purpose of this iteration is to distinguish if an assortment of electrical components complete an open or closed circuit fixed onto the protoboard of National Instrument's ELVIS. 

Programmed on Android Studio and Java and this includes the apk, flowcharts of the functionality of the app, Software Requirements Specifications, and only a tidbit of the source code, as this does not include all the intermdiate files generated by Android Studio.
